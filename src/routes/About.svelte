        Icedrop Games is a remote two-person gamedev team that makes little interesting games.

        <br><br>

        We believe in games that are like a frozen raindrop or a jewel: playful little crafted objects made with care that make you think and wonder.

        <br><br>

        We are working on a few <a href="/#/games" class="menu-option-link"><b>projects</b></a> we're very excited about.
